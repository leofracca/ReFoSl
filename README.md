# ReFoSl
ReFoSl is a program that helps you to relax, focus and sleep.
Just select the sounds you want to play and let them _ReFoSling_ you:blush:.
You can play one or more sounds and adjust the volume of each one, creating your best sounds environment to help yourself do what you're doing.
For example, I found it really useful during my programming sessions or when I study, especially when using the earphones.

All sounds are in .wav format to ensure the best possible experience with high quality audio.

**Relax. Focus. Sleep. This is ReFoSl.**

## How is it made
ReFoSl is a WPF project, built using the MVVM pattern.

### Libraries, frameworks and sources
The followings are used to make this project:
- [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro), for the easy implementation of the MVVM pattern
- [MahApps.Metro.IconPacks](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro.IconPacks), for the icons
- [MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit), for the style of the program
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/), [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) and [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/) for the amazing sounds

## Others
I wanted to make ReFoSl because all of the others similar projects needs a connection to internet and/or a premium subscription. With ReFoSl all the sounds are available for free and without an internet connection. Now and forever!:wink:
